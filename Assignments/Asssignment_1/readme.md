Question 01 :

In 1950, Turing sparked a debate: can machines truly think? He introduced the Turing Test and addressed objections to machine intelligence, some of which remain relevant today. One key objection is that machines, bound by rigid rules, can’t replicate the fluid, emotional nature of human behavior. Turing argued that human behavior follows natural laws machines could mimic, but many still doubt this equates to true understanding or consciousness.

Another objection comes from Gödel’s incompleteness theorems, suggesting machines can’t fully capture human intuition. Turing countered that humans also have limitations, though this doesn’t fully resolve concerns about the uniqueness of human insight.

Since Turing’s time, AI advancements like language models and deep learning have introduced new objections. While AI excels at pattern recognition and generating human-like text, it lacks genuine understanding. Issues like bias and transparency further complicate the debate.

Turing predicted that by 2000, a computer might have a 30% chance of fooling someone in a five-minute Turing Test. Today’s chatbots can mimic humans in short interactions but struggle with deeper conversations and true comprehension, showing that passing a test isn’t the same as real intelligence.

Turing’s work continues to challenge us. The objections he addressed—about formal rules, consciousness, and understanding—remain central to AI discussions. As technology advances, new ethical and philosophical questions emerge, highlighting that the quest for intelligent machines is as much about ethics and philosophy as it is about engineering.

Question 03:

Domain: Autonomous Delivery Robot in an Urban Environment

Agent Description:
The agent is an autonomous delivery robot designed to navigate city sidewalks, avoid obstacles, and deliver packages efficiently. It uses sensors (e.g., cameras, LiDAR) and mapping systems to interact with its environment.

Environment Characterization:
- Accessible: Partially (relies on sensors for real-time data).  
- Deterministic: Stochastic (unpredictable elements like pedestrians).  
- Episodic: Sequential (actions affect future states).  
- Static: Dynamic (environment changes over time).  
- Continuous: Both (time and space are continuous).  

Best Agent Architecture:
A hybrid architecture combining reactive (e.g., obstacle avoidance) and deliberative (e.g., route planning) components, supported by machine learning for adaptability.

Question 04:

1. False.
   Example: A poker-playing agent can be rational despite partial information.

2. True.
   Example: Chess requires planning; reflex agents cannot behave rationally.

3. True. 
   Example: In a trivial environment with only one action, all agents are rational.

4. False.  
   Agent program input: current percept. Agent function input: entire percept history.

5. False.  
   Example: Agent functions requiring solving the halting problem are not implementable.

6. True.  
   Example: In a task where all actions have the same outcome, random choice is rational.

7. True.  
   Example: A thermostat is rational in both home heating and lab temperature control.

Question 02 :
 1. Playing a decent game of table tennis (ping-pong).
Feasible: Yes.  
Robots like those from Omron can play table tennis using advanced sensors, real-time control, and motion planning.

2. Playing a decent game of bridge at a competitive level.
Feasible:Yes.  
AI systems like WBridge5 and NooK compete at high levels using game theory and machine learning.

 3. Writing an intentionally funny story.
Feasible: Partially.  
AI (e.g., GPT-4) can generate humor but struggles with cultural nuances, timing, and emotional depth.
 4. Giving competent legal advice in a specialized area of law. 
Feasible: Partially.  
AI tools like ROSS Intelligence provide legal information but lack deep reasoning and ethical judgment.
 5. Discover and prove a new mathematical theorem.
Feasible: Partially.  
AI (e.g., AlphaZero) can solve problems and verify proofs but lacks creativity for groundbreaking discoveries.
6. Perform a surgical operation.
Feasible: Partially.  
Robotic systems like da Vinci assist surgeons but cannot fully automate due to real-time decision-making and adaptability challenges.

7. Unload any dishwasher in any home.
Feasible: No.  
Robots lack the dexterity and adaptability to handle diverse objects and layouts.
 8. Construct a building.
Feasible: Partially.  
Robots can perform specific tasks (e.g., bricklaying, 3D printing) but cannot fully manage complex, adaptive construction processes.
Challenges for Infeasible Tasks:
- Funny stories: Subjectivity, cultural context, and emotional understanding.
- Legal advice: Complex reasoning, ethics, and ambiguity.
- Mathematical theorems: Creativity and deep intuition.
- Unloading dishwashers: Dexterity and adaptability.
- Constructing buildings: Coordination and handling unforeseen issues.
